DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph

Traversals --
[1]  DFS - Depth First Search (descendents in depth then 2nd child) - PREORDER
[2]  BFS - Breadth First Search (all children on same lvl then next) - LVLORDER

		 ____ Vertex
Graphs -|
		|____ Edges

(V-1)V  =  V^2 edges can be in directional graph


==[METHOD to STORE]==

Adjacency List
 
1.dictionary of list
[++] beneficial for non-dense graph
{
	0 : [2,4,5]
	2 : [4,3]
}

2. ==> i to j connection exists or not set to 1 if exists else 0
[++] beneficial for dense graph

 	       j
	    0 1 2 3 4
	 0  1 1 0 0 1
i	 1  0 0 1 1 0
	 2  0 0 0 1 0
	 3  0 0 0 0 0
	 4  0 1 0 1 0

this is directed
if graph is weighted then replace 1 corresponsing weight
