LEAP YEAR

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

1. The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
1.a. The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
1.a.a. The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

leap = False
    if year%4==0:
        if year%100==0:
            if year%400==0:
                leap = True
        else:
            leap = True
